# Shirubasoft.Aspire.ModularAppHosts.Testing

Run the same Aspire E2E test suite against an in-process AppHost or an Aspire-managed Docker Compose deployment. The package implements Compose mode through `IDistributedApplicationTestingBuilder` and keeps testing and Docker dependencies out of regular AppHosts.

```bash
dotnet add package Shirubasoft.Aspire.ModularAppHosts.Testing
```

Export the endpoints and values an external deployment test needs:

```csharp
compose
    .WithTestEndpoint(
        "catalog-api",
        catalog.Api.GetEndpoint("http"),
        healthCheckPath: "/health")
    .WithTestValue("Parameters:api-key", apiKey.Resource)
    .WithTestConnectionString("catalog", catalogDatabase);
```

Then select either testing builder while keeping the application lifecycle and assertions shared:

```csharp
await using IDistributedApplicationTestingBuilder builder = mode switch
{
    "apphost" => await DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder
        .CreateAsync<Projects.EShop_E2E_AppHost>(),
    "compose" => await DockerComposeDeploymentTestingBuilder
        .DeployAsync<Projects.EShop_E2E_AppHost>(),
    _ => throw new InvalidOperationException($"Unknown E2E mode '{mode}'.")
};

await using var app = await builder.BuildAsync();
await app.StartAsync();
await app.ResourceNotifications.WaitForResourceHealthyAsync("catalog-api");
```

`DeployAsync` deploys through Aspire, imports the resolved endpoints and configuration, and destroys the deployment when the builder is disposed. It prefers a restored local Aspire tool manifest, retries detected host-port bind conflicts once, and allows both behaviors to be overridden through `DockerComposeDeploymentOptions`. `Create` and `CreateFromEnvironment` import a deployment owned by another system.

Endpoint names and multiple endpoints per resource are preserved, so the same `CreateHttpClient(resourceName, endpointName)` calls work in both modes. Pass `DockerComposeDeploymentOptions` when CI needs an explicit environment, output path, Aspire CLI path, or deploy/cleanup timeouts. Aspire CLI output is streamed during deployment and cleanup.

The repository also includes a complete [catalog-and-orders sample](https://github.com/Shirubasoft/aspire-modular-apphosts/tree/main/samples/E2ETesting).
